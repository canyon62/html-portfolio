<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>A River Runs Through It</h3>
<p>A poetic film on life in Montana in the early 1900s. This film follows the protagonist Paul McClean and his life from youth to old age. It's filled with sweeping cinnematography, deep carachter development, and uses fly fishing as a thematic linchpin</p>
<h3>Top Gun</h3>
<p>While it may be somewhat predictable for a guy in his 40s to have this film so highly ranked, the "boys and their toys" theme at the height of 80s machismo is well portrayed. Mix that with a hooky story line and you've got a winner.</p>
<h3>Life as a House</h3>
<p>I don't think you'll find this lesser-known gem on a lot of top movie lists but this coming of age film paired whith a strong storyline and an interesting mix of characters may have the burliest of dudes in tears by its conclusion</p>
